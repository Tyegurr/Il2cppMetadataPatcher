# Tye's IL2CPP Metadata Patcher
A quick way to mod metadata files.

## Requirements:
- Node.js and the FS module.
- Basic JavaScript knowledge.

## How 2 Use:
In the script, replace the "targetPath" variable with the path to your metadata file.
Then, replace the "outputPath" variable to the path you want your output metadata file to be.

For the StringsToReplace variable, add an array for each string you want to replace.
The format is "[(Target string), (String to replace target with)]"

## How 2 Run:
In the command line, go to the directory you downloaded the stuff in. Then, run "node index.js".
